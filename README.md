# Vic-20-Emulator
This was a hobby project for me during the summer. The emulator was written from scratch in C++ using my MOS6502 implementation which is available in one of my repositories. The emulator is largely based on old technical documents and prior published analysis regarding the Vic-20. Plays the majority of games I've tested - not all.

Things to add (When time comes)
* Currently the emulator runs too fast, this can be fixed very easily by limiting the frames-per-second 
* The current program loading scheme is unintuitive

The following screenshots demonstrate the emulator in action.
